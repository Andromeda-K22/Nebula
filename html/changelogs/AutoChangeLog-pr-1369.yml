changes:
  - bugfix: Emagged airlocks can now be crowbarred close, after they're depowered.
  - tweak: Airlocks now use access lock components to decide their access, instead
      of circuitboards. Locks now use same UI as airlock electronics did for access
      setup. Mapped airlocks should spawn these as needed to work same.
  - tweak: Doors can now have their internal components damaged too like the rest
      of machinery. It won't happen until they're bashed down first though.
  - tweak: Access locks with auto-set option will automatically set their access to
      the area's on installation into machine (like doors do)
  - imageadd: Access lock components (and network lock) now have their own icons instead
      of reusing scanning module one.
